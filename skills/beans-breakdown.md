# Beans Breakdown Skill

## Purpose

Decompose features and epics into small, actionable task beans with appropriate duration estimates.

## Workflow

1. **Analysis**
   - Review the parent bean's requirements
   - Identify logical work units

2. **Task Creation**
   - Create task beans for each unit of work
   - Target duration: 2-5 minutes per task
   - Suggest test beans when appropriate

3. **Dependency Mapping**
   - Set blocking relationships between tasks
   - Ensure correct execution order

## Configuration

- `min_task_duration_minutes`: Minimum ideal task duration
- `max_task_duration_minutes`: Maximum ideal task duration  
- `suggest_test_beans`: Whether to suggest test beans for implementations

## Notes

This is a placeholder skill file. Full implementation will be added in a later task.
