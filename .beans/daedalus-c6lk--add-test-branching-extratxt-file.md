## Summary

Create a second trivial text file to validate multiple tasks squash-merging into the same parent feature branch.

## Implementation

Create `test-branching-extra.txt` in the project root with:

```
Extra test file for branch-per-bean validation
Created by task daedalus-XXXX
Tests that multiple tasks can squash-merge into the same feature branch.
```

Replace `daedalus-XXXX` with this bean's actual ID.

## Checklist

- [ ] Create `test-branching-extra.txt` in project root
